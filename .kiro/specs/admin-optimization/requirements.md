# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive admin system for managing cross-sell and upsell configurations in the CoffeeCraft e-commerce website. The admin system will be password-protected, hidden from public navigation, and provide a clean interface for toggling various sales optimization techniques on/off.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to access a secure admin panel, so that I can manage store configurations without exposing admin functionality to regular users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to /admin THEN the system SHALL display a login form
2. WHEN a user enters username "user" and password "password" THEN the system SHALL authenticate and grant access to the admin panel
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login screen
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login form when accessing admin routes
5. WHEN the admin link is present in navigation THEN the system SHALL hide it from public view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to configure upselling and cross-selling features, so that I can optimize sales strategies based on performance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the configuration panel THEN the system SHALL display toggles for all upselling techniques
2. WHEN an admin toggles "Frequently Bought Together" THEN the system SHALL enable/disable bundle recommendations on product pages
3. WHEN an admin toggles "You might also like" THEN the system SHALL enable/disable product recommendations in cart
4. WHEN an admin toggles "Free shipping progress bar" THEN the system SHALL show/hide shipping progress indicators
5. WHEN an admin toggles "Upsell offers after add to cart" THEN the system SHALL enable/disable post-cart upsell modals
6. WHEN an admin toggles "Cross-sell recommendations" THEN the system SHALL enable/disable recommendation sections
7. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL persist settings and apply them immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want a clean and intuitive admin interface, so that I can efficiently manage store settings without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized dashboard
2. WHEN viewing configuration options THEN the system SHALL group related settings logically
3. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for toggle states
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL display confirmation messages
5. WHEN there are unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL warn before navigation away from the page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want upselling features to appear or disappear based on admin configuration, so that my shopping experience reflects the store's current sales strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Frequently Bought Together" is enabled THEN the system SHALL display bundle offers on product pages
2. WHEN "You might also like" is enabled THEN the system SHALL show recommendations in cart/checkout flow
3. WHEN "Free shipping progress bar" is enabled THEN the system SHALL display shipping progress in cart
4. WHEN upselling features are disabled THEN the system SHALL hide corresponding UI elements completely
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to manage session security, so that admin access remains secure and sessions expire appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
2. WHEN an admin is inactive for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out
3. WHEN an admin logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and redirect to login
4. WHEN an admin closes the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain session for security duration
5. WHEN multiple login attempts fail THEN the system SHALL implement basic rate limiting
