# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing e-commerce coffee shop application to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality. The refactoring will focus on implementing best practices, improving code organization, and making the codebase easier to edit and extend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the application SHALL maintain a clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories for types, constants, hooks, and utilities
2. WHEN components are organized THEN the system SHALL group related components together and separate business logic from presentation logic
3. WHEN the file structure is reviewed THEN each directory SHALL have a clear purpose and follow consistent naming conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript types and interfaces, so that I can avoid type-related bugs and improve code reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL have centralized type definitions that are reused across components
2. WHEN interfaces are created THEN they SHALL be properly exported and imported to avoid duplication
3. WHEN type safety is implemented THEN all components SHALL use proper TypeScript types without any implicit types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable custom hooks, so that I can share logic between components and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is extracted THEN it SHALL be moved to custom hooks that can be reused across components
2. WHEN state management is implemented THEN complex state logic SHALL be encapsulated in custom hooks
3. WHEN hooks are created THEN they SHALL follow React hooks conventions and be properly tested

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent constants and configuration, so that I can easily modify application settings without hunting through multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized in dedicated constant files
2. WHEN configuration values are used THEN they SHALL be imported from a single source of truth
3. WHEN magic numbers or strings are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with named constants

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and readable component code, so that I can quickly understand and modify component behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL follow the single responsibility principle
2. WHEN component logic is complex THEN it SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused functions
3. WHEN components are large THEN they SHALL be split into smaller, composable components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling and loading states, so that the application provides a reliable user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error boundaries
2. WHEN async operations are performed THEN loading states SHALL be consistently managed
3. WHEN error states are displayed THEN they SHALL provide meaningful feedback to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance, so that the application loads quickly and responds smoothly to user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be prevented using React optimization techniques
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be properly optimized and lazy-loaded where appropriate
3. WHEN expensive operations are performed THEN they SHALL be memoized or optimized appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent styling and theming, so that the UI remains cohesive and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styles are applied THEN they SHALL use consistent design tokens and utility classes
2. WHEN custom styles are needed THEN they SHALL be organized in a maintainable way
3. WHEN theming is implemented THEN it SHALL be centralized and easily configurable
