# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables dynamic product configuration through integration with the Taager backend API. Administrators will be able to configure which product SKUs appear in different sections of the website (home page, product details, recommendations, frequently bought together, upsell offers) through an admin dashboard. The system will fetch product data dynamically from the Taager API using configured SKUs and display them across the website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure API credentials for the Taager backend, so that the system can authenticate and fetch product data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL provide a section to configure Taager API credentials
2. WHEN API credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials by making a test API call
3. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL securely store the API key and taagerId
4. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure which product SKUs appear in different website sections, so that I can control the product display dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the product configuration section THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for all website sections
2. WHEN configuring the home page THEN the system SHALL allow selection of one primary product SKU for the product details section
3. WHEN configuring product recommendations THEN the system SHALL allow selection of up to 3 product SKUs
4. WHEN configuring frequently bought together THEN the system SHALL allow selection of up to 3 product SKUs
5. WHEN configuring upsell offers THEN the system SHALL allow selection of product SKUs for post-checkout display
6. WHEN SKU configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL validate that all SKUs exist in the Taager API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see dynamically loaded product information on the home page, so that I can view current featured products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor loads the home page THEN the system SHALL fetch product data for the configured primary SKU from the Taager API
2. WHEN product data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display the product name, description, price, images, and specifications
3. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message or default product information
4. WHEN product data is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate language (Arabic/English) based on user preference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see relevant product recommendations, so that I can discover related products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor views product pages THEN the system SHALL fetch data for configured recommendation SKUs from the Taager API
2. WHEN recommendation data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display up to 3 recommended products with images, names, and prices
3. WHEN a visitor clicks on a recommended product THEN the system SHALL navigate to that product's detail page
4. IF recommendation API calls fail THEN the system SHALL hide the recommendations section gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see frequently bought together products, so that I can consider bundle purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor views a product page THEN the system SHALL fetch data for configured "frequently bought together" SKUs
2. WHEN bundle data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display up to 3 products in a "frequently bought together" section
3. WHEN bundle products are displayed THEN the system SHALL show combined pricing and individual product details
4. WHEN a visitor adds bundle items THEN the system SHALL add all selected items to the cart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see relevant upsell offers after checkout, so that I can consider additional purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor completes checkout THEN the system SHALL fetch data for configured upsell SKUs from the Taager API
2. WHEN upsell data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display upsell products on the thank you page
3. WHEN upsell offers are displayed THEN the system SHALL show product details, pricing, and purchase options
4. WHEN a visitor purchases an upsell item THEN the system SHALL process the additional order

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle API failures gracefully, so that the website remains functional even when the backend is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Taager API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached product data if available
2. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and display fallback content
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling and retry logic

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to preview configured products before publishing, so that I can verify the configuration is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator configures SKUs THEN the system SHALL provide a preview function
2. WHEN preview is activated THEN the system SHALL fetch and display product data for all configured SKUs
3. WHEN product data is previewed THEN the system SHALL show how products will appear on the live website
4. IF any configured SKUs return errors THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic configurations
