# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will migrate the admin configuration storage from client-side localStorage to server-side SQLite database storage. This will ensure configuration persistence across devices, browsers, and deployments while maintaining the simplicity of a single-app deployment with no external database dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want my configuration changes to persist on the server, so that settings are maintained across different devices and browser sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin saves configuration changes THEN the system SHALL store the configuration in a server-side SQLite database
2. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel from any device THEN the system SHALL load the latest configuration from the server
3. WHEN the browser localStorage is cleared THEN the system SHALL still maintain the admin configuration from server storage
4. WHEN the application is redeployed THEN the system SHALL preserve existing admin configurations
5. WHEN multiple admins access the system THEN the system SHALL show the same consistent configuration state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want the system to work reliably even if there are temporary server issues, so that I can continue managing the store without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to localStorage as a backup
2. WHEN server connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any local changes to the server
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
4. WHEN loading configuration fails THEN the system SHALL use cached localStorage data if available
5. WHEN both server and localStorage fail THEN the system SHALL use default configuration values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple database setup that deploys with the application, so that there are no external database dependencies or complex infrastructure requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the SQLite database if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL include the SQLite database file in the deployment
3. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL handle schema updates automatically
4. WHEN the database is corrupted THEN the system SHALL recreate it with default values
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL provide a simple way to export/import configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want configuration changes to be applied immediately across the site, so that I can see the effects of my changes without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is saved to the server THEN the system SHALL update the client-side cache immediately
2. WHEN feature toggles are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes to frontend components without page refresh
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL prioritize server data over cached data
4. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for immediate configuration propagation
5. WHEN configuration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using server data as the source of truth

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want audit capabilities and error handling, so that I can track configuration changes and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp and change details
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN configuration is reset THEN the system SHALL record the reset action with timestamp
5. WHEN system health checks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for monitoring database connectivity
